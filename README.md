# How to Not Get Murdered
## A Data Analyst's Guide

### Project Overview

We have selected the influence of demographics on the homicide solve rate in California as the topic for our final group project. In getting to know one another we found that we have a shared fondness for true crime documentaries and thought it would be interesting to look into trends in the solve rates for homicide cases in our home state. More specifically we hope to answer the following questions:

- Is there a correlation between the personal attributes of the victim and the solve rate? 
- Is there a correlation between county demographics where the murder occurred and the solve rate?
- Can we develop a machine learning model that predicts whether or not a crime would be solved given hypothetical sets of circumstances?

Our source data comes from two datasets found on Kaggle:
1. [U.S. Homicide Reports, 1980-2014](https://www.kaggle.com/jyzaguirre/us-homicide-reports): 24 columns,

2. [US Census Demographic Data](https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data/data?select=acs2015_county_data.csv)
	- 37 columns (2 string, 35 numerical)
